Event Management API
Create an API for managing events where users can:

Create, update, and delete events.
View upcoming and past events.
Register for events with different roles (e.g., attendee, speaker).

Use-Case :

User: Represents the users of the system (attendees, speakers, etc.).
Event: Represents the events being managed.
Registration: Represents the relationship between users and events (e.g., which user is registered for which event, with roles like attendee or speaker).

Summary of Models:

Event: Stores event details like name, date, and location.
Speaker: Stores speaker details like name, bio, and email.
Ticket: Stores ticket details like price and type, and links to an event.
Registration: Links users to events and tickets, representing user registrations.
Feedback: Stores feedback for events or speakers, including ratings and comments.

In the Speaker model, the bio property is defined as DataTypes.TEXT instead of DataTypes.STRING because TEXT is typically used for longer text fields, while STRING is generally for shorter, fixed-length text.

The bio field is meant to hold a description or biography, which can vary in length and might be much longer than a typical string. By using TEXT, you're allowing for more flexibility to store longer content without hitting any length limitations, which can be a limitation when using STRING (especially for very large pieces of text).
